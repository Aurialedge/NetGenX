# NetGenX: AI-Enabled Cyber Incident Web Portal for Defence üõ°Ô∏è

## üí° Problem Statement
Defence cyber complaints in India often suffer from **delayed response times** because they are frequently "buried in NCRP's civilian load." These delays significantly increase operational risks and leave defence personnel, their families, and veterans vulnerable to cyber threats.

### The Critical Need:
A dedicated, secure, and swift AI-driven portal is needed for the **exclusive and immediate handling of defence-specific cyber incidents**, ensuring timely protection for the defence ecosystem.

## ‚ú® Solution: NetGenX Defence Cyber Shield
**NetGenX** is a dedicated Cyber Safety Portal built for the Indian defence ecosystem‚Äîpersonnel, families, and veterans. It aims to provide **instant threat analysis** using AI/ML and ensure **immutable, tamper-proof evidence storage** using a combination of Blockchain and IPFS.

### Innovation Highlights
* **Tamper-Proof, Auditable Evidence:** Leverages **Blockchain + IPFS** for decentralized storage and immutable proof of existence, ownership, and timestamp.
* **Rapid Threat Analysis:** **AI-powered analysis** classifies threats in under **<2 seconds**.
* **Real-time Escalation:** Instant integration and escalation to **CERT-Army** for immediate response.
* **Multi-Format Forensics:** Capable of analyzing evidence in various formats, including **Text, Audio, Video, and Files**.

## üíª Technical Approach

### Architecture Flow
The system follows a three-group methodology to ensure security, speed, and integrity:

1.  **Decentralized Upload (IPFS Storage Group):**
    * Users securely upload files via a React UI.
    * Files are stored on **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System) to generate a **Unique, Immutable Content ID (CID)**.
2.  **AI-Powered Scanning (AI/ML Analysis Group):**
    * The file is retrieved, and **Threat Analysis** is performed.
    * A **Python & TensorFlow** model analyzes file content using **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to generate a Threat Report and assign a **Severity/Risk Score**.
3.  **Immutable Ledger & Response (Reporting & Blockchain Group):**
    * The CID and the AI Report are logged onto the **Ethereum Blockchain** via a **Solidity Smart Contract**, creating a permanent audit trail.
    * **Automated Response:** If the **Risk Score Exceeds a Threshold**, an automatic **Alert is Sent to CERT-Army**, and the user is provided with actionable Mitigation Steps.
    * All entries get permanent access for Audit and Verification.

### Tech Stack

## üöÄ Future Plans
The team is committed to continuous enhancement for future-proof security:

* **Preventive Detention:** Use Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and predictive AI to preemptively block threats.
* **Autonomous Operations:** Enable AI-driven threat hunting and automated deception techniques.
* **Future-Proof Security:** Upgrade to quantum-resistant cryptography.

## üéØ Target Audience
The portal's primary users include:

* Defence Personnel
* Defence Personnel Families
* Defence Veterans
* CERT-Army (for incident response)
